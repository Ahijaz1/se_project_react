_Project WTWR:_

This is a React application built with Vite that displays weather-based clothing recommendations. It fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and dynamically suggests garments suitable for the current weather. The app features a responsive design, a modal form to add new clothing items, and a mobile-friendly navigation menu.

_Project 14: Full-Stack Application:_. **Backend** [se_project_express](https://github.com/Ahijaz1/se_project_express.git)

This project marks an important milestone in my software engineering journey, building and connecting a frontend and backend to create a complete full-stack web application.

The goal of this project was to integrate user authentication, profile management, and interactive features such as liking and filtering items. This frontend interacts with my custom-built backend API to handle all user and data operations securely.

_Project Overview:_

- This application allows users to:
- Register and log in securely using JWT authentication
- Edit their profile (name and avatar)
- Add, like, and view clothing items
- View personalized content based on user authentication
- Sign out to clear session data
- The project demonstrates the use of React Context, protected routes, API integration, and state management to build a dynamic and secure - user experience.

_Technologies Used_

Frontend:

- React (JSX, Hooks, Context API)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (modular structure)
- Fetch API for server communication

Backend:

- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- JWT Authentication
- RESTful API Architecture
